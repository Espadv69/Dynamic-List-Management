# Dynamic List Management with Delete Functionality

## Objective
Create a dynamic list where users can delete items. Practice using React's `useState` hook and the `.filter()` method to manage and update the list.

## Steps
1. Set up a React project with `useState` to manage a list of items.
2. Create a component to display each item in the list.
3. Pass a delete function from the parent component to the child component using props.
4. Use the `.filter()` method to remove the selected item from the list.
5. Update the state with the new list and re-render the UI.
